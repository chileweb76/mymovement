# MyMovement

## Description

Web app built with Next.js using Tailwind CSS and MongoDB. The app allows a user to signup for an account using Google authentication. The user can then create a database from four topics: food, mood, meds, and bowel movement. The goal is to allow the user to see how these affect each other.

## Motivation

I have family members that suffer from gut issues. It would be nice to have an app to document their bowel movements along with other factors so that they could possibly find a pattern of what causes the issue. Unfortunately the only apps available are expensive and very involved. This app simplifies things down to the necessary.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
