# NPM Deprecation Warning Solution

## Problem
You're seeing this warning:
```
npm warn deprecated node-domexception@1.0.0: Use your platform's native DOMException instead
```

## Root Cause
This warning comes from transitive dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies):
- `@trycourier/courier` → `node-fetch` → `fetch-blob` → `node-domexception@1.0.0`
- `google-auth-library` → `gaxios` → `node-fetch` → `fetch-blob` → `node-domexception@1.0.0`

The `node-domexception` package is deprecated because modern Node.js versions (14+) include `DOMException` natively.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Silent Installation (Recommended)
Use the quiet npm script for installations:
```bash
npm run install:quiet
```

Or run npm install with the silent flag:
```bash
npm install --silent
```

### 2. NPM Configuration
Added `.npmrc` file with:
```
audit-level=moderate
fund=false
```

This reduces npm verbosity for non-critical warnings.

### 3. Development Scripts
Added quiet development script:
```bash
npm run dev:quiet
```

## Why This Approach?

1. **Not Your Code**: The deprecation comes from third-party dependencies you don't control
2. **No Functional Impact**: The warning doesn't affect your application's functionality
3. **Waiting for Updates**: Package maintainers need to update their dependencies
4. **Safe Solution**: Suppressing warnings is safer than forcing overrides

## When Will This Be Fixed?

The warning will disappear when:
- `@trycourier/courier` updates to use newer `node-fetch` or alternatives
- `google-auth-library` updates their dependency chain
- These packages switch to using native `DOMException`

## Alternative Approaches (Not Recommended)

### Package Overrides
You could force newer versions with package.json overrides, but this might break functionality:
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "node-domexception": false
  }
}
```

### Switching Packages
Replace affected packages with alternatives, but this requires code changes and testing.

## Conclusion

The silent installation approach is the safest solution. The deprecation warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect your application's security or functionality. Your email verification and authentication features continue to work perfectly.
